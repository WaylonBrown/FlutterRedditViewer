# Reddit Flutter Viewer

A simple Reddit Android/iOS app written in Flutter, limited to only 5kb of Dart code for [Flutter Create](https://flutter.dev/create).

Instructions: The app is simple, it lists the top posts in the Hot category on Reddit currently. One can pull-to-refresh or click on a post to view the content.

There would normally be slightly better variable names and more error handling - some of which was yanked out at the end to hit the 5kb limit without removing functionality.
